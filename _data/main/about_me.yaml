short_description: PhD student in Computer Vision working on Visual Representations
content: I'm a third year Computer Vision PhD student at [ISIR](https://www.isir.upmc.fr) lab from [Sorbonne University](https://www.sorbonne-universite.fr) and Thales CortAIx Lab under the supervision of [Nicolas Thome](https://thome.isir.upmc.fr).
         I am currently working on visual representations, focusing on the use of foundation vision encoders for dense vision tasks. My research interests include diffusion models, self-supervised and weakly supervised learning and feature upsampling.
